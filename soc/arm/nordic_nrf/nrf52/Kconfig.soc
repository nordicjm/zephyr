	  Due to Anomaly 132 LF RC source may not start if restarted in certain
	  window after stopping (230 us to 330 us). Software reset also stops the
	  clock so if clock is initiated in certain window, the clock may also fail
	  to start at reboot. A delay is added before starting LF clock to ensure
	  that anomaly conditions are not met. Delay should be long enough to ensure
	  that clock is started later than 330 us after reset. If crystal oscillator
	  (XO) is used then low frequency clock initially starts with RC and then
	  seamlessly switches to XO which has much longer startup time thus,
	  depending on application, workaround may also need to be applied.
	  Additional drivers initialization increases initialization time and delay
	  may be shortened. Workaround is disabled by setting delay to 0.
