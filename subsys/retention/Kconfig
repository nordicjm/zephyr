	help
	  Enables support for the retention system, which uses retained memory
	  drivers.

config RETENTION_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Retention devices init priority"

	help
	  Retention device initialization priority (must be higher than init
	  priorities for retained memory drivers).

config RETENTION_MUTEX_FORCE_DISABLE
	bool "Disable retention mutex support"

	help
	  Disable use of mutexes which prevent issues with concurrent retention
	  device access. This option should only be enabled when retention
	  access is required in an ISR or for special use cases.

	  Size of buffers (stack based) used when reading and writing data
	  from/to the retention device.

config RETENTION_BOOT_MODE
	bool "Boot mode"
	help
	  Adds a boot mode system that allows for changing execution flow
	  depending upon the value of a boot mode parameter. Can be used for
	  e.g. button-less bootloader serial recovery mode entering from the
	  application.

	  In order to use this, a retention area with at least 1 usable user
	  byte must be created and set as the "zephyr,boot-mode" chosen node
	  via device tree.

menuconfig RETENTION_BOOTLOADER_CONFIG
	bool "Bootloader configuration"
	depends on SETTINGS
	help
	  Adds a bootloader configuration sharing system which allows for
	  retreiving information from the bootloader when data sharing is
	  enabled via the settings system with the "blinfo" prefix.

	select MCUBOOT_BOOTUTIL_LIB
	help
	  Adds a bootloader configuration sharing system for MCUboot and
	  applications which allows applications to read the configurion of
	  MCUboot and the running image. This can be used by applications so
	  that they know how to e.g. handle firmware updates and place them
	  into the correct slot.

	  In order to use this, a retention area must be created and set as
	  the "zephyr,bootloader-config" chosen node via device tree, MCUboot
	  must be built with the same "zephyr,bootloader-config" DTS node and
	  have CONFIG_BOOT_SHARE_DATA and CONFIG_BOOT_SHARE_DATA_BOOTINFO
	  enabled, or the shared information will not be accessible.

config RETENTION_BOOTLOADER_CONFIG_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Bootloader configuration init priority"
	default 87
	help
	  Bootloader configuration initialization priority (must be higher
	  than init priorities for for retention subsystem).
